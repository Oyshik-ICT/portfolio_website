            <h1>SimpleBanker</h1>
            <p>
                This is simple console-based bank application developed using OOP principles in python. Now I am learning OOP in python. 
                So I created this using OOP. Through this project user can perform common banking operations like
                create new account, display all accounts, update an account, delete an account, deposit amount, withdraw amount.
                I have  plans to expand and modify this project in the future as I learn more about oop concepts. Click the github icon to see the code.

            <h1>My Protfolio Website</h1>
            <p>
                Recently I have learned HTML and CSS. So I thought that it would be a great idea to 
                create a portfolio webside using this two language. As a result, I created this website, which includes a brief biography 
                about my education and learning journey. Currently, I am working to make this website responsive.
