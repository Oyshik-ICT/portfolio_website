            <p id="varsity_p">In the ICT department, I gained valuable insights into technology. 
                While initially unfamiliar with programming and coding competitions, I learned these skills from our seniors. 
                The curriculum covered a range of information and communication technology courses. Beyond academics, being part of a diverse public university exposed me to various backgrounds and perspectives. 
                I developed the ability to interact and collaborate with people of different characteristics. 
                This experience has significantly enhanced my communication skills, allowing me to engage effortlessly with a variety of individuals, a skill I didn't possess before joining the university.
