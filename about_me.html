                Hello I'm Mohtasim Faiyaz Oyshik
           </h3>
           <div id="content2" class="content">
                I'm a student at the Islamic University in Kushtia, studying Information and Communication Technology. 
                I'm a self-learner and didn't have any programming experience before joining university. 
                In my first year, I picked up C and basic C++ and started solving problems using these languages. 
                I learned about data structures and algorithms in C, thanks to the programming books by Tamim Shahriar Subeen. 
                I practiced problem-solving on platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, LeetCode, CodingNinja, HackerRank, and more.

                Moving into my third year, I added Python to my skill set and began solving problems with it. 
                I delved into data structures and algorithms again, but this time using Python. I gained a basic understanding of operating systems. 
                Recursion, dynamic programming, basic graph problems, and challenging topics were tackled with the help of Striver's YouTube channel.
                This channel, run by a Google software engineer, provided valuable perspectives.
                I participated in coding contests like CodeJam, HackerCup, and Meta Hackathon. In my fourth year, I'm working on an HTML and CSS portfolio. 
                I'm also learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and working on a related project.

                In the future, I want to learn about databases because I dream of becoming a software engineer. 
                I really enjoy exploring different parts of technology. Besides tech stuff, I love going to new places and trying out all sorts of tasty foods. 
                My passion for learning, both in tech and in life, is what keeps me excited about my career goals.
